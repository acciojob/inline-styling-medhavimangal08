		<p>Lilies are among the oldest cultivated plants. In Asia Minor during the 2nd millennium bce the bulb of the Madonna lily was cultivated for use in a medicinal ointment; the ancients raised the bulbs of this species for food. The Greeks and Romans grew it for ornamental and medicinal purposes. During the Middle Ages the Madonna lily was associated with the Virgin Mary as a symbol of purity; it is often included in paintings of her. In East Asia various species of lilies were grown as food and ornamental plants from an early date.</p>
